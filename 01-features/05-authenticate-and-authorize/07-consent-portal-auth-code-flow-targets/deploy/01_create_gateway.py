"""Create the AgentCore Gateway that the consent portal will front.

Creates, idempotently:
  1. The gateway service role (AmazonBedrockAgentCoreGatewayRole-<GATEWAY_NAME>),
     unless GATEWAY_SERVICE_ROLE_ARN is set. It needs the AgentCore Identity
     token operations, because the gateway itself performs the outbound
     authorization code flow against GitHub on the user's behalf, plus read
     access to the
     identity service's own OAuth secrets and CloudWatch Logs.
  2. The gateway: protocolType MCP, inbound authorizerType CUSTOM_JWT over
     your IdP's OIDC discovery URL.

Two details that are load-bearing and easy to get wrong:

  * supportedVersions must include "2025-11-25". That MCP protocol version is
    what enables URL-mode elicitation, which is how the gateway asks an
    unconsented user to authorize an authorization-code-flow target. On older
    versions only, an
    AUTHORIZATION_CODE target has no way to prompt.

  * The gateway's authorizer and the consent portal's IdP credential provider
    must reference the SAME OIDC issuer. CreateConsentPortal validates this at
    create time, so a mismatch is rejected in step 02 rather than at login.
    Both read IDP_DISCOVERY_URL from .env, so they agree by construction.

On a re-run the authorizer config is reconciled if it drifted (a rotated
GATEWAY_CLIENT_ID or a discovery URL edited by hand) — both of those surface
at runtime as an opaque 401 during MCP initialization.

Writes to .env: GATEWAY_ID, GATEWAY_URL, GATEWAY_MCP_URL,
GATEWAY_SERVICE_ROLE_ARN.

If the consent portal later answers `login_unavailable` on GET /login, re-run
this with --reapply-authorizer. Re-sending an unchanged authorizer makes the
portal re-resolve it; a portal created before the gateway's authorizer was
resolvable otherwise stays broken with a deliberately non-diagnostic error.

Run from the sample root:
    python deploy/01_create_gateway.py --entra
    python deploy/01_create_gateway.py --okta
    python deploy/01_create_gateway.py --okta --reapply-authorizer
