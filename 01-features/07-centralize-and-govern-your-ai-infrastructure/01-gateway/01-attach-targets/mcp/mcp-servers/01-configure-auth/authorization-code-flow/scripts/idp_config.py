"""Primary-IdP configuration for the consent portal scripts.

Sibling to mcp_config.py, and deliberately the same shape. mcp_config.py answers
"which MCP server am I attaching?" from scripts/servers/<name>.json; this module
answers "which identity provider do end users sign in to?" from
scripts/idps/<name>.json. Two directories because the two things vary
independently: one gateway's portal can front a GitHub target under Entra ID
today and an Atlassian target under Okta tomorrow.

Every script that touches the portal takes a **required** --<idp> flag, one per
file in idps/, for the same reason the MCP scripts do: no default, no environment
fallback, because a script that guessed its IdP could delete the wrong portal.

The profile holds the IdP's *shape* -- vendor, which env vars carry its values,
how its discovery URL and scopes are spelled. The tenant-specific *values* stay
in the environment, because they belong to the reader's tenant and not to this
repository:

    ENTRA_DISCOVERY_URL   OIDC discovery document; MUST contain /v2.0/
    ENTRA_RESOURCE        idpConfig.audience -- the resource app GUID
    ENTRA_ALLOWED_SCOPES  space-separated, fully qualified
    PORTAL_CLIENT_ID      the portal's own confidential client app
    PORTAL_CLIENT_SECRET  its secret (getpass fallback; never printed)

Adding Okta is a new idps/okta.json plus a --okta flag that appears on its own.

The .env helpers are reused from mcp_config rather than re-rolled.
