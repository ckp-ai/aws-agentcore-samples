"""Delete the gateway and its IAM role for one MCP server profile.

Both names are derived from the profile, so this deletes exactly what
deploy_gateway.py created.

Refuses to run while any target is still attached. Targets are
cleanup_targets.py's job, and a gateway is shared -- deleting it out from under
a sibling server's target would break that server. Run cleanup_targets.py
first.

Does NOT delete the Cognito stack; the README deletes that explicitly, since
other tutorials share it.

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/cleanup_gateway.py --github
